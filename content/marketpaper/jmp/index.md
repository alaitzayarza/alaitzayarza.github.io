summary: <p align="justify"><span style="font-family:Lora">This paper studies the determinants of young and highly educated individuals' migration choices in lagging-behind regions, with a focus on expected career and non-career related factors. I collect a rich data set on subjective expectations at the time when individuals are making migration choices in one of the poorest regions of Spain. The use of subjective expectations data to estimate a life-cycle model of migration choice allows me to mitigate the identification problem regarding the separation of preferences and beliefs. I find that both expected career-related outcomes and non-career related outcomes are significant determinants of the choice between no-migration, short-term and long-term migration. To quantify the relative role of the two set of outcomes on migration choices I perform counterfactual exercises. My results show that non-career related factors play a larger role than career-related ones. For example, the change in the expected probability of choosing to not migrate is about 60\% larger when individuals expect the same non-career outcomes across choices than when they perceive equal career related outcomes across them.</span>
