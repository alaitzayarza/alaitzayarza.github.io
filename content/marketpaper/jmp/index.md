summary: <p align="justify"><span style="font-family:Lora">This paper studies the relative role of pecuniary and nonpecuniary outcomes on migration choices of young individuals in their school-to-work transition. I design and conduct a survey of more than 600 last year bachelor’s degree students who are at the time of making their migration decision in an economically distressed area of Spain. I then estimate a life-cycle model that uses the rich data on students’ subjective expectations. I find that young individuals are highly responsive to expected earnings as well as full-time employment and study-job match prospects. Nonpecuniary factors are also statistically and economically significant determinants, but their total value is lower than previously estimated. Counterfactual exercises show that nonpecuniary factors play a larger role than pecuniary factors.</span>
