This limits the university's role as a tool to foster social mobility. I study the mechanisms underlying university graduates' different geographic location choices by socioeconomic status. I use an information experiment to investigate the role of information frictions and study credit constraints and other costs (e.g., knowledge of the language) as alternative mechanisms.</span>
