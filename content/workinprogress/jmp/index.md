#summary: <p align="justify"><span style="font-family:Lora">Why do young adults migrate? This paper studies the reasons behind migration choices of young, highly educated individuals from lagging-behind regions. I collect a rich dataset on subjective expectations at the time when respondents are making their choice of whether to migrate out of Andalusia, one of the poorest regions of Spain. I then use the data to estimate a life-cycle model of migration choice, taking migration duration into account. Crucially, the collected data allow me to separate preferences from beliefs and to distinguish between pecuniary and nonpecuniary factors. Regarding pecuniary factors, I find that migration decisions are more sensitive to earnings, followed by the prospects of full-time employment and a better match between studies and job. Although there is sorting on expected labor market outcomes, my results show that the set of nonpecuniary factors, such as being close to family and quality of social life, play a larger role in choosing whether to migrate. Given the large expected likelihood of short-term migration, I study the reasons for planning to migrate temporarily. Counterfactual exercises show that a human capital acquisition strategy plays a small role on the plan to migrate short-term. Instead, expected short-term migration is largely motivated by preferences for nonpecuniary outcomes.</span>

summary: <p align="justify"><span style="font-family:Lora"> Using original survey data on subjective expectations, I study how highly educated young adults from lagging regions evaluate no migration, short-term migration, and long-term migration. First, I show that individuals anticipate sharp trade-offs&colon; long-term migration delivers the highest career gains but large non-career losses, while no migration offers strong non-career advantages but weak career prospects. I then embed these expectations in a life-cycle utility model and perform counterfactual exercises. Results show that differences in expected non-career outcomes have larger effects on intended migration paths. Expected career improvements in the home region upon return are not perceived to be large enough to meaningfully influence the choice of short-term migration. Finally, I use the estimated preferences to assess policies that encourage short-term migration by guaranteeing better career prospects after return. These policies have stronger effects on those planning long-term migration than on those planning no migration. Matching these effects with cash transfers requires large payments and produces lower welfare among switchers. A follow-up survey four years later validates the expectations data by showing that expectations strongly predict realized migration choices and outcomes.</br></br><ins>Presented at</ins>&colon; SAEe (Valencia, December 2022), SOLE (Philadelphia, May 2023), BSE Summer Forum (Barcelona, June 2023), Workshop on Subjective Expectations (Bocconi-Milan, June 2023), Workshop on Migration and Family Economics (IESEG-Paris, June 2023), EEA-ESEM (Barcelona, August 2023), EALE (Prague, September 2023), WB-IDB HUMANS Seminar (Washington, March 2024), CUNEF Universidad (Madrid, April 2024), Jornadas de Economía Laboral (Barcelona, July 2024), CERGE-EI (Prague, December 2024)</span>
