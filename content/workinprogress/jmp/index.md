#summary: <p align="justify"><span style="font-family:Lora">Why do young adults migrate? This paper studies the reasons behind migration choices of young, highly educated individuals from lagging-behind regions. I collect a rich dataset on subjective expectations at the time when respondents are making their choice of whether to migrate out of Andalusia, one of the poorest regions of Spain. I then use the data to estimate a life-cycle model of migration choice, taking migration duration into account. Crucially, the collected data allow me to separate preferences from beliefs and to distinguish between pecuniary and nonpecuniary factors. Regarding pecuniary factors, I find that migration decisions are more sensitive to earnings, followed by the prospects of full-time employment and a better match between studies and job. Although there is sorting on expected labor market outcomes, my results show that the set of nonpecuniary factors, such as being close to family and quality of social life, play a larger role in choosing whether to migrate. Given the large expected likelihood of short-term migration, I study the reasons for planning to migrate temporarily. Counterfactual exercises show that a human capital acquisition strategy plays a small role on the plan to migrate short-term. Instead, expected short-term migration is largely motivated by preferences for nonpecuniary outcomes.</span>

summary: <p align="justify"><span style="font-family:Lora"> This paper studies how expected career and non-career returns shape migration decisions among highly educated young adults from lagging regions in advanced economies. I collect data on subjective expectations at the time of decision-making under three counterfactual migration scenarios&colon; no migration, return migration, and long-term migration. First, I document strong anticipated trade-offs between career and personal life outcomes across alternatives. Second, to disentangle preferences from beliefs, I incorporate ex-ante returns into a life-cycle utility model. The results show that non-career factors overweigh career considerations in expected choices and welfare, explaining why short-term migration is preferred over long-term migration. Third, counterfactuals reveal that removing the expected benefits of short-term migration leads most short-term migrants to opt for no migration rather than long-term migration, with responses varying by ability. The relative role of each expected benefit on planning to return also depends on ability. For instance, anticipated career gains upon return matter only for the highest-ability individuals. Finally, I find that promoting short-term migration is about three times more cost-effective for high-ability individuals who initially plan to stay than for those planning long-term migration, underscoring the challenge of retaining talent in lagging regions. A follow-up survey confirms that initial expectations strongly predict realized migration choices and outcomes. These findings highlight the central role of non-career factors in migration decisions and provide new insights for designing cost-effective policies to retain talent.</br></br><ins>Presented at</ins>&colon; SAEe (Valencia, December 2022), SOLE (Philadelphia, May 2023), BSE Summer Forum (Barcelona, June 2023), Workshop on Subjective Expectations (Bocconi-Milan, June 2023), Workshop on Migration and Family Economics (IESEG-Paris, June 2023), EEA-ESEM (Barcelona, August 2023), EALE (Prague, September 2023), WB-IDB HUMANS Seminar (Washington, March 2024), CUNEF Universidad (Madrid, April 2024)</span>
