#summary: <p align="justify"><span style="font-family:Lora">Why do young adults migrate? This paper studies the reasons behind migration choices of young, highly educated individuals from lagging-behind regions. I collect a rich dataset on subjective expectations at the time when respondents are making their choice of whether to migrate out of Andalusia, one of the poorest regions of Spain. I then use the data to estimate a life-cycle model of migration choice, taking migration duration into account. Crucially, the collected data allow me to separate preferences from beliefs and to distinguish between pecuniary and nonpecuniary factors. Regarding pecuniary factors, I find that migration decisions are more sensitive to earnings, followed by the prospects of full-time employment and a better match between studies and job. Although there is sorting on expected labor market outcomes, my results show that the set of nonpecuniary factors, such as being close to family and quality of social life, play a larger role in choosing whether to migrate. Given the large expected likelihood of short-term migration, I study the reasons for planning to migrate temporarily. Counterfactual exercises show that a human capital acquisition strategy plays a small role on the plan to migrate short-term. Instead, expected short-term migration is largely motivated by preferences for nonpecuniary outcomes.</span>

summary: <p align="justify"><span style="font-family:Lora"> This paper examines how expected career and non-career returns shape migration decisions among highly educated young adults from lagging regions in advanced economies. I collect data on subjective expectations under three counterfactuals&colon; no migration, return migration, and long-term migration. First, I show that individuals anticipate significant trade-offs between effects on career and non-career outcomes. Second, I separate preferences from beliefs by incorporating these ex-ante returns into a life-cycle utility model. Results reveal that personal life factors play a larger role than career considerations in choices and welfare. Third, I perform counterfactual exercises to study the reasons for planning to return, and estimate the cost of promoting this choice among those initially preferring the other options, focusing on differences by ability. My findings help inform the design of policies incentivizing return migration in lagging regions, a way to encourage early-career skill acquisition while retaining talent. A follow-up survey conducted four years later validates the methodology, confirming a strong link between expectations and realizations.</br></br><ins>Presented at</ins>&colon; SAEe (Valencia, December 2022), SOLE (Philadelphia, May 2023), BSE Summer Forum (Barcelona, June 2023), Workshop on Subjective Expectations (Bocconi-Milan, June 2023), Workshop on Migration and Family Economics (IESEG-Paris, June 2023), EEA-ESEM (Barcelona, August 2023), EALE (Prague, September 2023), WB-IDB HUMANS Seminar (Washington, March 2024), CUNEF Universidad (Madrid, April 2024)</span>
