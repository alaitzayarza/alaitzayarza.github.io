#summary: <p align="justify"><span style="font-family:Lora">Why do young adults migrate? This paper studies the reasons behind migration choices of young, highly educated individuals from lagging-behind regions. I collect a rich dataset on subjective expectations at the time when respondents are making their choice of whether to migrate out of Andalusia, one of the poorest regions of Spain. I then use the data to estimate a life-cycle model of migration choice, taking migration duration into account. Crucially, the collected data allow me to separate preferences from beliefs and to distinguish between pecuniary and nonpecuniary factors. Regarding pecuniary factors, I find that migration decisions are more sensitive to earnings, followed by the prospects of full-time employment and a better match between studies and job. Although there is sorting on expected labor market outcomes, my results show that the set of nonpecuniary factors, such as being close to family and quality of social life, play a larger role in choosing whether to migrate. Given the large expected likelihood of short-term migration, I study the reasons for planning to migrate temporarily. Counterfactual exercises show that a human capital acquisition strategy plays a small role on the plan to migrate short-term. Instead, expected short-term migration is largely motivated by preferences for nonpecuniary outcomes.</span>

summary: <span style="font-family:Lora">*(Under review)*</span></br><p align="justify"><span style="font-family:Lora"> Using original survey data on subjective expectations, I examine how expected career and non-career returns shape migration choices among highly educated young adults from lagging regions in advanced economies. I document strong trade-offs between professional and personal life returns across three counterfactual migration scenarios. A life-cycle utility model shows that non-career factors drive migration choices and welfare, explaining why short-term migration is preferred over long-term migration. Removing short-term migration benefits shifts more short-term migrants to staying than to long-term migration, with responses varying by ability. Policy simulations show promoting short-term migration is three times more cost-effective for high-ability stayers than long-term migrants. A follow-up survey confirms that initial expectations strongly predict realized migration choices and outcomes.</br></br><ins>Presented at</ins>&colon; SAEe (Valencia, December 2022), SOLE (Philadelphia, May 2023), BSE Summer Forum (Barcelona, June 2023), Workshop on Subjective Expectations (Bocconi-Milan, June 2023), Workshop on Migration and Family Economics (IESEG-Paris, June 2023), EEA-ESEM (Barcelona, August 2023), EALE (Prague, September 2023), WB-IDB HUMANS Seminar (Washington, March 2024), CUNEF Universidad (Madrid, April 2024), Jornadas de Econom√≠a Laboral (Barcelona, July 2024), CERGE-EI (Prague, December 2024)</span>
